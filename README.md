## ðŸš€ Quick start

# This is simple project with Gatsby and GraphQL technologies. In project I also used styled-components library to quick implement css styles.

1.  **Create production version.**

    npm run start

2.  **Start developing version.**

    npm run develop

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
